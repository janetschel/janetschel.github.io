## Welcome to my start page for code.janetschel.dev

Actually, you shouldn't be here. I **only** use this subdomain for different websites (they are accessed via the path).

So if you are here, you just visited the main-page without any page. Welp.. nothing much to see here.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/janetschel/janetschel.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
