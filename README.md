## Welcome ???

Actually, you shouldn't be here. I **only** use this subdomain to keep track and 'index' different websites via the path.  
This just means that I publish some of my personal projects to this domain ([for example](https://code.janetschel.dev/brainfuck-visualizer/)).

So if you are here, you just visited the main-page without any path (this shouldn't happen); you visited no specific project.

Welp, I hate to break it to you, but nothing to see here...
